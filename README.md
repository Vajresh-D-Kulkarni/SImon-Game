# Simon-Game
Simon is an electronic memory game where players repeat increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds. Players must mimic the pattern presented by the game, with each correct sequence extending by one. The game tests memory and reaction skills, challenging players to keep up as the patterns grow longer.
